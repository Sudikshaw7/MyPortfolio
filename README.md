# Sudiksha Wandre Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It features a cool, minimal pixel game aesthetic with retro fonts and subtle animations.

## Features Implemented
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap for mobile-friendly layout, ensuring the site looks great on all devices.
- **Form Validation**: JavaScript validation on the contact form to check for required fields and valid email format.
- **Hamburger Menu**: Bootstrap's built-in navbar toggler for a collapsible menu on smaller screens.
- **Email Integration**: Basic mailto link for form submission (can be upgraded to EmailJS for real email sending without backend).
- **Animated Website**: CSS keyframes for fade-in, slide-up, and background animations; JS for scroll-triggered effects.
- **Season Toggle Button**: A button to cycle through three themes (summer, winter, rainy) that change colors, backgrounds, and add effects like rain or snow.
- **About Section**: Includes personal info, GitHub, LinkedIn, and email links.
- **Projects Section**: Placeholder for projects with links to GitHub.
- **Pixel Game Theme**: Uses 'Press Start 2P' font, pixelated borders, shadows, and minimal retro styling.
